# Template with opinionated folder structure

## About this template
This is a custom template with opinionated folder structure.\
It has also been configured to use absolute paths for the directories
(as explained in this [blog](https://dev.to/mr_frontend/absolute-imports-in-create-react-app-3ge8)]

## Folder structure
```
src
|---_assets
|       (static files ex. images, global css)
|---adapters
|       (Connectors of application to outside world)
|---contexts
|       (a bare minimum folder only containing the state of the components)
|---components
|       (self-explanatory)
|---pages
        (container or pages containing the components)
```
